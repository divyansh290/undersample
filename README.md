# 🧠 OCR and Undersampling Machine Learning Pipeline

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline that combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with undersampling techniques to handle imbalanced data. The objective is to extract text from images using Tesseract OCR, preprocess it, and apply undersampling to balance the dataset for more effective model training.

## 📌 Features

- Extracts text from images using Tesseract OCR
- Handles class imbalance using random undersampling
- Trains and evaluates a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression)
- Visualizes results with plots and metrics
